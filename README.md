# Enoristante Boccaccio: My First Deployed Website (2020)

- This project was my first website ever deployed online (the site was made for the restaurant that was my father's). It was initially developed in 2020 and later uploaded to GitHub in 2022. The main goal was to go through the entire process of creating and launching a web project, from design to deployment.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in:

- **Building responsive pages**: Ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.
- **Performance optimization**: Improving loading speed and optimizing image performance.
- **SEO best practices**: Writing content that enhances search engine ranking.
- **Accessibility considerations**: Making the site more inclusive and user-friendly.

## Features

- Two routes: one in Italian and one in English.
- A simple and clean UI built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap**.
- A downloadable menu available for users.

Even though the site is no longer online, this project was an essential step in my web development journey.
